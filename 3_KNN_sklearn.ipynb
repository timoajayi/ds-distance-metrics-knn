    "KNN is a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm. When we say a technique is non-parametric, it means that it does not make any assumptions about the underlying data. In other words, it makes its selection based off of the proximity to other data points regardless of what feature the numerical values represent. Being a lazy learning algorithm implies that there is little to no training phase. Therefore, we can immediately classify new data points as they present themselves."

However, for the sake of simplicity, we’ll pick a couple at random (Feel free to have a look at the data, print the correlations and choose the most appropriate features). \n",
